# mean-rest-boilerplate
A quick and easy REST boilerplate for web apps using the MEAN stack.

##Getting Started
This boilerplate uses the metaphor of music records. Find and replace all
instances of the words "Record", "Records", "record" & "records" (case
*sensitive*) for your desired functionality. Change the mongo database and
collections to suit your needs. This boilerplate uses "artist", "album" and
"year". These instances are marked with a TODO for easy reference.

###server.js
Contains Angular hooks for you to update as desired. Change ng-app,
ng-controller, and formData to suit your needs.

###config/database.js
Update your Mongo DB information here.

###app/routes.js
Set your form parameters here for creating entries in DB.

###app/models/record.js
Mongo schema lives here. Create a new file for your needs.

##That's All
